# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Zach.

I am a **.Net developer** with a passion for **game development**. With a fascination for games and a desire to bring my ideas to life, I strive to continue to learn and expand my skillset to enable me to create interactive experiences that will bring joy and entertainment to others!

## Current Projects

I'm currently collaborating with a colleague on two major projects, both of which are games, which is where I dedicate most of my personal developing time. These projects are currently private repos and we have goals of publishing both games in the future. Both are online multiplayer games, one is a mobile role-playing game, and the other is a fast-paced fighting computer game!

## Past Projects

Here are some of the past projects I've made:

1. **[Lifting Journal](https://github.com/zosterday/lifting-journal)** - A razor pages web app that allows you to log your weight, sets, and repetitions for specific exercises, and track the progress you make and the records you set!

2. **[Flying Game](https://github.com/zosterday/flying-game-unity)** - A 3d Unity game where the player controls a plane with their mouse and has to make it through the checkpoints that spawn in front of them at continuously increasing speed. If a checkpoint is missed, then it's game over!

3. **[Dodge Game](https://github.com/zosterday/dodge-game)** - A 2d Unity game where the player tries to dodge the obstacles that spawn. If the player makes contact with an obstacle then they lose!

4. **[Marble Gem Collection Simulation](https://github.com/zosterday/marble-collect-sim)** - A 3d Unity simulation where marbles bounce around the field to collect as many gems as possible. Size multiplier, gem collection amount multiplier, and speed boost powerups also spawn that can boost a marbles chance of winning. The marble with the most gems at the end is the winner!

5. **[Marble Knockout Simulation](https://github.com/zosterday/marble-knockout-lms)** - A 3d Unity simulation where marbles bounce around a platform, which has barriers conintuously removed until only one marble, the winner, remains!
  
6. **[Marble Pinball Simulation](https://github.com/zosterday/marble-pinball-comp)** - A 2d Unity simulation where marbles of different color spawn and they fall and bounce around pinball style obstacles into zones worth different amounts of points. The color with the most points at the end is the winner!
   
7. **[Virus Simulation](https://github.com/zosterday/virus-simulation)** - A 2d Unity simulation that takes an infection chance on contact and a chance to heal after 10 seconds of being infected and simulates the spread of a virus!

Feel free to explore these projects and see what I've been up to! ðŸš€
